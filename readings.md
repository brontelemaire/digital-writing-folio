# Readings

## Week 1

##“Decolonize” E-Literature? On Weeding the E-lit Garden Kathi Inman Berens
###As I know nothing around the culture of eLit it’s interesting reading about apparent problems within it. It was also cool to think about small already normalised things being considered or at least debatably eLit like memes. I felt a bit like the outsiders to eLit that was discussed, who sees coding as this magic I can’t understand and therefore too daunting to approach. It’s also good to think about concepts like anti-racism before even beginning instead of having to retroactively look back at work and see if there’s things that need changing.

##Electronic Literature: what is it? N Katherine Hayles
###I have already struggled with what the hell literature within itself is supposed to be, so adding eLit to that, does only muddle me more, though in a way also makes me more apathetic to the concept of literature. Why care what it’s defined as, as long as it’s good art? I wonder if it eLit is something that could be sometimes pushed too far away from print or other forms, othering itself to make it seem cooler than it is, as it’s a problem I have in a lot of circles that deal with a particular form and the difficulty to see the acknowledgement that there can be equivalencies across different forms like films and theatre. 
###What is cool about eLit is that it is hopefully archived for the future basically automatically because it exists on the internet. It will never be gone, or at the very least it is hard to destroy unlike print which we have constantly lost over hundreds of years. The Archiving process is a lot safer. 

##The Origins of Electronic Literature: An Overview G Rosario, N Meza, K Grimaldi
###I had only considered eLit to have been a more recent (as in past 20-30 years) creation in the literature world but of course as soon as new technology is available, artists will always attempt to utilise it to create as fast as they can. Though in grand scheme of other art forms it’s still incredibly new, it has existed three times the amount I have. And art and technology has been developing at an extremely fast rate as technology and knowledge has built on itself to new highs, so I imagine the landscape of eLit is rapidly changing and adapting , though it is good to know there is a history to fall back on.

##Week 2

##Enlightening Interactive Fiction: Andrew Plotkin’s Shade Jeremy Douglass
###One thing that is very fun about eLit or at least typical of the choose-your-own-adventure genre is that the reader gets to step into the story themselves. This is rarely seen in general written work as second person is rarely employed formally (though you will find it more on social media, even in crude jokey forms like “pov: you ate too much lettuce” on TikTok). This reading at the very least made me appreciate Shade from a distance even though I gave up on completing it myself, as well as my friends who stared at my laptop for over an hour trying to get it to work and find another synonym for “tap” that would hopefully work. It did make me appreciative of what it was trying to do (as well as actually find out what it’s about and therefore connect its presentation with the text).

##Kissing the Steak: The poetry of Text Generators Christopher T. Funkhouser
###I honestly struggled a lot with this reading, I don’t have the vocabulary to understand a lot of it at the moment. Though I do think I appreciate what was being said about how kinetic works can add meaning.
