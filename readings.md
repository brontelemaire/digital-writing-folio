# Readings

## Week 1

## “Decolonize” E-Literature? On Weeding the E-lit Garden Kathi Inman Berens
### As I know nothing around the culture of eLit it’s interesting reading about apparent problems within it. It was also cool to think about small already normalised things being considered or at least debatably eLit like memes. I felt a bit like the outsiders to eLit that was discussed, who sees coding as this magic I can’t understand and therefore too daunting to approach. It’s also good to think about concepts like anti-racism before even beginning instead of having to retroactively look back at work and see if there’s things that need changing.

## Electronic Literature: what is it? N Katherine Hayles
### I have already struggled with what the hell literature within itself is supposed to be, so adding eLit to that, does only muddle me more, though in a way also makes me more apathetic to the concept of literature. Why care what it’s defined as, as long as it’s good art? I wonder if it eLit is something that could be sometimes pushed too far away from print or other forms, othering itself to make it seem cooler than it is, as it’s a problem I have in a lot of circles that deal with a particular form and the difficulty to see the acknowledgement that there can be equivalencies across different forms like films and theatre. 
### What is cool about eLit is that it is hopefully archived for the future basically automatically because it exists on the internet. It will never be gone, or at the very least it is hard to destroy unlike print which we have constantly lost over hundreds of years. The Archiving process is a lot safer. 

## The Origins of Electronic Literature: An Overview G Rosario, N Meza, K Grimaldi
### I had only considered eLit to have been a more recent (as in past 20-30 years) creation in the literature world but of course as soon as new technology is available, artists will always attempt to utilise it to create as fast as they can. Though in grand scheme of other art forms it’s still incredibly new, it has existed three times the amount I have. And art and technology has been developing at an extremely fast rate as technology and knowledge has built on itself to new highs, so I imagine the landscape of eLit is rapidly changing and adapting , though it is good to know there is a history to fall back on.



## Week 2

## Enlightening Interactive Fiction: Andrew Plotkin’s Shade Jeremy Douglass
### One thing that is very fun about eLit or at least typical of the choose-your-own-adventure genre is that the reader gets to step into the story themselves. This is rarely seen in general written work as second person is rarely employed formally (though you will find it more on social media, even in crude jokey forms like “pov: you ate too much lettuce” on TikTok). This reading at the very least made me appreciate Shade from a distance even though I gave up on completing it myself, as well as my friends who stared at my laptop for over an hour trying to get it to work and find another synonym for “tap” that would hopefully work. It did make me appreciative of what it was trying to do (as well as actually find out what it’s about and therefore connect its presentation with the text).

## Kissing the Steak: The poetry of Text Generators Christopher T. Funkhouser
### I honestly struggled a lot with this reading, I don’t have the vocabulary to understand a lot of it at the moment. Though I do think I appreciate what was being said about how kinetic works can add meaning.



## Week 3

## Indistinguishable from Magic: Invisible Interfaces and Digital Literature as Demystifier Lori Emerson
### The concept that we today have a different relationship with media is something I hadn’t considered before but something that made a lot of sense. It’s everywhere we go in form of advertisements outside and in the digital world, art is more affordable/free and accessible than ever, we listen to music almost everywhere, and art is imbedded into every little thing when we go online. Being able to read these things is thus important, knowing what means what, and it’s helpful to know how it was created in the first place. Programming is often really mystified by anyone who hasn’t attempted it before, and still is for people who only know it’s bare basics like me. It seems like an important step in our education system to start teaching about programming at a young age so people can be more technically literate and navigate through a technology run age.

## Beyond Taxonomy: Digital Poetics and the Problem of Reading Talan Memmott
### Poetry has always been a little difficult to define just in print version. It can more obvious with staggered lines, incredibly metaphoric wording, or have a lot of technical language like rhyming. But it gets more difficult when you get to things like prose poetry. Poetry becomes just about anything you decide to call poetry. It’s the recommended Google searches that come up, or a bunch of book spines in a row. Doesn’t mean it’s good, but it doesn’t mean it’s not poetry either. Then digital poetry makes this even more complicated, because at the end of the day we have more or less defined it in print, but when the form is much more mouldable electronically you need to rethink the definition. 



## Week 5

## No Sense of an Ending: Hypertext Aesthetics Epsen J. Aarseth
### Hyperlinks have always existed in my experience of the internet so they’re not new to me but using it in fiction is new to me. It of course comes with a lot of assumed rules and implied uses. Such as you only see bits of text at a time, so it is more controlled by the author, it’s therefore more fragmentary, and therefore it being linear or not is very important. And so, then I have to think whether these effects are what I want if I want to go forward with a project using hyperlinks as the base, as if it turns out I don’t want it to feel fragmentary, then I need a new approach. It also means the reader has to think more when it’s choice-based hypertext in order to make sure they aren’t already walking on mapped ground, but its gamifying could ruin the read. 

## Hypertext Fiction Ever After Stuart Moulthrop
### It’s intriguing to look at the history of hypertext which in my assumption in the simplest eLit genre there is and therefore has a much longer history than newer forms as it uses standard programming in comparison say to a kinetic poem because hyperlinks weren’t created for art but just to navigate the internet. It’s also good to see that Twine has made a big impact on the eLit community by keeping the hyperfiction’s head above water and therefore makes me trust the program more.


## Week 6

## Riddles Nick Montfort
### It makes sense that at its core interactive fiction is essentially riddles. You are trying to use its language and information given to you to figure out what to do next or the “answer”. I suppose also trying to write code is a bit of a riddle as well, trying to use the tools you’ve been given to get the end that you want, and figuring out which extra bracket is ruining the effect you’re trying to make. And poetry on it’s on is a riddle. You are trying to figure out what it’s usually nonliteral story is actually talking about using the clues you’ve been given, so when combined with interactive fiction, it’s a riddle on two or possibly three levels. 

## On Savoir-Faire Emily Short
### This reading inly cemented that interactive fiction where the reader types in commands is eLit that’s not for me both as a reader and creator. I find it difficult to keep track of where you are or what’s surrounding you as well as figuring out the exact wording you should type to be a huge pain and incredibly annoying when the author is not local as they will use certain words and language that you wouldn’t. It does however make me interested in what’s possible in Bitsy because I’m sure the difference in the type of interaction is not too dissimilar especially with things such as items which you can collect in game. Though that isn’t grabbing me to use for my project I can imagine using it in the future.



## Week 7

## The Paradox of Poetic Gaming: evidence of everything exploding Astrid Ensslin
### Ludic mechanics does make a clearer definition of what a game actually is and makes it a lot easier to analyse pieces of work to see if they are actually designed as a game and then effect how to read it accordingly. But the reading also raised that often regardless of whether they have ludic mechanics, eLit can often call itself a game whether it be in its title, description or implied due to the site it’s hosted on. This then makes the definition muddy because are we then calling these works games because they indeed are games or because that’s what they’ve name themselves. Though I do also just put forward the thought does it matter whether or not it lives up to these definitions of a game if it changes the reading anyway. 

## Poetic Playlands: Poetry, Interface, and Video Game Engines Jason Nelson
### I’m not surprised that games will have more pull than other forms of eLit or just text. Interactivity and the idea you can win or lose something or be good or bad at something is a huge pull factor for people and adds another layer when discussing with someone else or adds another reason to share it with them. Entertainment often comes in more predominantly, and of course a reader will get more enjoyment where entertainment is core. I don’t plan on having a win lose aspect to my project at all though I will be using Bitsy, as I just want it as a parallel visual story, though because it is a Bitsy, it would likely have more draw and a bigger audience than if it was just the Twine as visuals and video game presentation still draws people. Hugely narrative based games that don’t allow different branches or endings are still huge in the video game scene such as indie games like The Beginners Guide (a narrated walk through experience) and Night in the Woods (same ending regardless of choices and aspects that you could “lose” at like playing the guitar are inconsequential).



## Week 9

## Excavating Logics of White Supremacy in Electronic Literature: Antiracism as Infrastructural Critique Ryan Ikeda
### "White supremacy is less concerned with the value of visual signifiers (e.g., color; skin tone, etc.) than it is with how hierarchies of difference use visual signifiers to project value onto bodies, to regulate aesthetics, and to distribute power inequitably."
### Though unsurprising, it’s still disappointing to know that barely any spaces, if any, are void of structural and systemic problems. Though of course it’s this hope that can continue to make it exist, if we don’t look for it, how are we supposed to get rid of it. Blindness or chosen ignorance doesn’t mean the problem isn’t there an embedded into the structure of how we share works, whose works we get to see, and what types of works we value. White supremacy has existed for a very long time in literary history alone and so to choose to believe that just because we’ve moved to a different medium it would somehow be different would be wishful thinking or just idiotic. 
### This type of detangling that needs to occur won’t happen overnight, nor over the next year, but it can slowly build on itself at the very least, finding which cracks we need to repair one by one even if it makes more cracks visible. Art of every medium should be available for everyone to use without barriers stopping them before they’ve even started.



## Week 10

## Arriving Simultaneously: Selections from a writer’s Notebook Judy Molloy
### It was interesting to see a public archive as I myself have a private one, but I wasn’t grasping on what made it particularly eLit. You do get updates on what has happened in her life like you would a blog (which it essentially is) but how different is it from seeing a diary apart from it being more public? You could even compare it to weekly entries in a newspaper. Though it is encouraging the idea of me making a public archive, it’s hard to – or maybe I shouldn’t in the first place – see it as anything more than a public diary and maybe not even eLit to begin with.



## Week 11

## Publishing Electronic Literature James O’Sullivan
### As expected, publishing is very different when it comes to eLit because it essentially publishes itself. As I will have a Netlify link when I finish my project, anyone that has it will just be able to access it, I don’t need someone else to transform it into something new. You could say that this is the way it should be, with the relationship between author and reader being far more direct without a middleman facilitating the relationship. What publishing is good for however, is often there is more eyes on the work. A self-published book will rarely do as well as a book published by an established publishing house, also aided by the fact it’s more likely to go through a rigorous editing and culling process, so more good things end up at the top of the pile rather than the self-published scene which can be a mix between gold and garbage. 
### It also means when it comes to eLit that the author needs to maintain the work sometimes. Maybe the site it’s hosted on changes, maybe it becomes outdated somehow. Like when Flash was being removed as a feature a lot of people and players/readers were scrambling to figure out what to do with Flash games. It also means they can update it more easily, however. If bugs are found or more ideas are made, an author can simply alter it whenever they please, using reader feedback as well.
