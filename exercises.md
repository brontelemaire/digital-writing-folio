### What types of writing do you do (ie fiction, nonfiction, poetry, other)?

- Fiction
- Non-fiction
- Poetry
- Essay

### What tools (or techniques) do you use to write?

- Word documents, Google documents, Apple notes app
- Do planning/gathering of ideas in notes app
- FadeIn
- Write out prose in word doc
- Copy into Google doc in order for other people to see and edit and look at it with more fresh eyes
- Using a document to jump around to different sections, copying and pasting them into different orders, developing one idea more
- Usually write in bed
- Speak outloud to see how things sound, occassionally record
- Walk around to understad the space physically in a piece of work
- Write with headphones on with no sound or with curated and specific playlists made for the work
- Usually write at night when there's less noise
- Put deleted sections into other docs to use/look at later
- Use sites like picrew to create character's visuals
- Use textboxes to move text around
- Use text alignment for different effects on the form
- Hop between multiple projects at the same time, when I get stuck on one I just switch to the other
- Printing off work to manually edit with coloured pens
- Using google tab groups to collate research

###  Why do you use these tools (or technique)?
- Habit
- Familiarity with tools
- Able to write fast enough

### How do these tools shape the way you write (e.g., constrain that way you write or facilitate your writing)?

Constrain:
- Stuck on the A4 visualisation, doesn't show you how it would actually look in print, also makes it seem as though you've done less than you have
- Can't play as easily with form of things like poetry as I can on paper cause I can sketch visuals out
- Get distracted easily by phone or other things open/on my laptop

Facilitate:
- Let me organise more thoroughly and know where everything is (I notoriously lose things)
- Easier to do workshopping with other people (Google doc's commenting system)
- Having ideas in notes means I can look at them whenever I want as long as I have my phone, and so can do it more discreetly and speedily
- I can write in the dark
- Can use autocorrect to help with my spelling and missing words I might have otherwise missed
- Can keep myself in the zone with music
- Can multitask, have multiple things next to each other on my screen or on my phone to use as reference



## Week 2:

### We used a few ai generators which was a sketchy dive for me going in as I’ve been watching the discourse around ai generators for the past few years as they’ve ramped up as companies are taking lower quality art that doesn’t understand itself through ai generators instead of having to pay artists who know what they’re doing but take much longer. So going in I was a bit sceptical, and I wasn’t entirely wrong, the writing that was outputted by ChatGPT was not very good and lacked soul in it and just ran itself in circles. And most importantly, it was boring. But what was fun to use, however, was jGnoetry. Not because it was good at writing poems, but because it was bad enough to be interesting. Because it didn’t understand grammar or punctuation, it then used it in strange and new ways a person wouldn’t. I put in some of my own recent writing with a little bit of Dadaist structure put in the settings, and watched it use the words I use regularly in ways I wouldn’t, which has sparked new ways to write my current side project.

### Some of the outputs I liked:
### -	Continue to make it manageable self-destruction
### -	One step closer to be immortal as a pair of life without permission
### -	Smiling at the vulgar promises to die
### -	You the monstrous stalk
### -	You realised what I’d kill I wasn’t ready to
### -	Shake gently taken whole
### -	You despise even now the nothingness that punched though my presence

## Week 4
### “We Walk to You” remix on glitch. 
### It was good to see there’s tools to make eLit a lot easier like Glitch because I would have absolutely no basis to make something like this infinite story/poem. It is also becoming slightly less daunting to look at code, though most of it still scares me a little, at least the changes I care most about don’t seem entirely unintuitive.

## Week 5
### We started using Twine as it’s much simpler than I thought it could be which is reassuring since I was already thinking of using it or a similar program for my piece. Hyperlink stories with multiple choices however are way harder to plan than I realised. It would be so easy to just keep making different choices available and end up with 50 endings by accident. It’s super humbling now to look at pieces like Depression Quest which now I realise must be extremely long when looking at all of the text and is ten times the amount of work than a regular short story. 
### I made the template of a basic one that has two endings. A choice between two is available at the start, and the once more, and then when the third time to choose comes around, the four current story streams go into two endings, though one of each from each “half” so to say, so there’d be the illusion of more choice.
