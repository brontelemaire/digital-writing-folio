- Can't play as easily with form of things like poetry as I can on paper cause I can sketch visuals out
- Get distracted easily by phone or other things open/on my laptop

Facilitate:
- Let me organise more thoroughly and know where everything is (I notoriously lose things)
- Easier to do workshopping with other people (Google doc's commenting system)
- Having ideas in notes means I can look at them whenever I want as long as I have my phone, and so can do it more discreetly and speedily
- I can write in the dark
- Can use autocorrect to help with my spelling and missing words I might have otherwise missed
- Can keep myself in the zone with music
